# Canonical projects of web faculty

Projects are created on the basis of platform materials without taking into account the material given by tutors.

*The chosen approaches may not seem optimal. However, they correspond to the solution of the current tasks.
Some code snippets contain comments on improvements and optimization as well as alternative solutions.*

### Navigation through repository:
Each project work is located in a separate branch with a corresponding name, for example, node/sprint-13 or html/sprint-2

### [Issues](https://gitlab.com/pcr-web/web-canonicals_en/-/issues)

### If there is something you want to push into the project:
* Pull-requests are welcome. Make branches in format `type/name`, i.e. `bugfix/header`
* Write short, meaningful commits. Use [this](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/ru/v1.0.0-beta.4/)
